A long, long time ago (like, seriously, almost 4 months ago from when I am writing this), Notch of MineCraft fame ported his Minecraft4k project to Javascript.

This is my attempt to break this down to where a lowly web developer (me) to a point that I can understand how this works (when I am not playing Minecraft).

From my understanding of the discussion on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4862830) there are much better ways of doing this with Canvas and Javascipt.  Maybe someday I'll explore that.
